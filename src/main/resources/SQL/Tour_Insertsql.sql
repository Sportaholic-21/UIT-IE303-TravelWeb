'Paris is divided into four distinct seasons. The best tourist season is from late spring (April) to early summer (June) and around autumn because this is the time when Paris "shows off" the best of this city. 
If you come to Paris in the spring, you will definitely love the romantic beauty of this place, this season is also the favorite season of the French. Like spring in every other country, spring in France is filled 
with flowers all over the streets, on balconies and in every little house. You will see Paris appear like a familiar movie: People wearing thin robes, sitting at outdoor cafes enjoying a cup of coffee while looking at the street.
In summer, the weather is pleasant, the hottest is only up to 32 °C because this is a temperate country. At this time, people often gather at public swimming pools, artificial seas to soak in the water, to sunbathe and enjoy cool
drinks to dispel the heat. Only one drawback is that tourists flock to this season very crowded. Next to autumn, the weather is cooler than summer, sometimes there will be rain, so in general, the weather is humid and a bit cold. 
Therefore, if you travel in the fall, you should also prepare a thick coat and umbrella in case it suddenly rains. In winter, the temperature will be quite harsh for people from tropical countries like us because during the day, 
it is quite cloudy, the day is cold. ',
